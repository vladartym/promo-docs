Tasks let you send forms to your roster and collect structured responses — feedback, availability, photo uploads, and more. Each task is linked to a published form and has a deadline for submissions.

## Prerequisites

- An active agency account with admin access
- At least one [published form](/agencies/forms) in your account

## Viewing your tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Tasks page">
    Click **Tasks** in the sidebar to see all your tasks. Each task shows its name, completion progress, deadline, and current status.

## Understanding task statuses

Each task displays a status badge based on its deadline and completion:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **In Progress** | The deadline hasn't passed and responses are still coming in |
| **Completed** | All assigned ambassadors have submitted their responses |
| **Overdue** | The deadline has passed and some ambassadors haven't responded |
| **Cancelled** | The task was manually cancelled |
