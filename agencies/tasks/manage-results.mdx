Once ambassadors start submitting responses, you can review results question-by-question, read AI-generated summaries, manage assignments, and share a results page with your client.

## Reviewing results

## Managing assignments

    Switch to the **Assigned** tab to see all ambassadors assigned to this task. Use the filter tabs (**All**, **Pending**, **Completed**, **Overdue**) or the search bar to find specific people.

  <Step title="Send reminders or remove assignments">
    Click the three-dot menu next to any ambassador to **Send Reminder** (for overdue or pending) or **Remove** them from the task.

## Sharing results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share with your client">
    Click the **Share** button in the task header to open the share modal. Copy the public link or enter an email address to send it directly. The public results page shows anonymized responses (first name and last initial only).
