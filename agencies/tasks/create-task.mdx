Create a task to send a form to selected ambassadors with a deadline. Assigned ambassadors receive an email notification and can submit their responses from their dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- An active agency account with admin access
- At least one published form (go to **Forms** to create one)

## Creating a task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create Task">
    From the **Tasks** page, click the **Create Task** button in the top-right corner. This opens the task creation form.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a form">
    Click the **Form** dropdown and choose one of your published forms. The dropdown shows each form's name and number of questions. After selecting, the task name auto-fills with the form name — you can change it to something more descriptive.

    <Tip>
      If you don't have a form yet, click **Create New Form** to build one. You can also click **Edit Form** to modify the selected form before creating the task.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a deadline">
    Click the **Deadline** field to open the date picker and select the due date. Ambassadors must submit their responses by end of this day. Past dates are disabled.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign ambassadors">
    Click **Select Ambassadors** to open the assignment modal. Browse or search your roster by name, email, or phone. Check the boxes next to the ambassadors you want to assign, or use **Select all** to assign everyone. Click **Done** when finished.

    <Tip>
      You can skip this step and assign ambassadors later from the task detail page.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the task">
    Review your selections and click **Create Task**. Assigned ambassadors will receive an email notification with a link to complete the task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

<Note>
  The task uses the questions from your selected form at the time of creation. Editing the form later won't change existing tasks.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Give your task a descriptive name (e.g., "Toronto Launch Event Feedback" instead of just "Post-Event Feedback Form") so ambassadors know exactly what it's for.
</Tip>
