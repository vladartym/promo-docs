Forms let you build custom questionnaires that can be attached to tasks or activations. Use them to collect specific information from brand ambassadors — feedback after events, availability confirmations, check-in details, and more.

## Prerequisites

- An active agency account with access to the dashboard

## Creating a form

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Forms page">
    From your agency dashboard, click **Forms** in the sidebar. You'll see a list of all your existing forms, each showing the form name, description, question count, and creation date.

    Click the **Create Form** button in the top-right corner.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter form details">
    On the Create Form page, fill in the **Form Name** (required) and an optional **Description**. The name helps you identify the form when attaching it to tasks later.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a question">
    Click **+ Add Question** to add your first question. Each question has:

    - **Question text** — The question ambassadors will see
    - **Answer Type** — Choose from Short Text, Paragraph, Multiple Choice (Radio), Multiple Choice (Checkbox), Star Rating (1-5), or File Upload
    - **Required toggle** — Make the question mandatory or optional

    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      Use **Star Rating** for quick satisfaction scores and **Paragraph** for open-ended feedback. **File Upload** is useful for collecting photos or documents.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add multiple choice options">
    When you select **Multiple Choice (Radio)** or **Multiple Choice (Checkbox)** as the answer type, an **Options** section appears. Type each option and click **+ Add Option** to add more.

    Radio questions allow ambassadors to select one answer. Checkbox questions allow multiple selections.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Duplicate or archive a form">
    Click the **three-dot menu** on any form card to access quick actions:

    - **Edit** — Open the form builder
    - **Duplicate** — Create a copy of the form with all its questions
    - **Archive** — Remove the form from your active list

    You can also archive a form from the edit page using the **Archive Form** button.

## Question types reference

| Type | Best for | Ambassador input |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Short Text | Names, short answers | Single-line text field |
| Paragraph | Detailed feedback, comments | Multi-line text area |
| Multiple Choice (Radio) | Single selection from options | Radio buttons |
| Multiple Choice (Checkbox) | Multiple selections | Checkboxes |
| Star Rating (1-5) | Satisfaction scores, ratings | 1-5 star selector |

<Tip>
  Forms integrate with the **Tasks** feature. When creating a task, you can attach a form to collect structured responses from ambassadors alongside the task completion.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Duplicating a form copies all questions and options, making it easy to create variations of existing forms without starting from scratch.
