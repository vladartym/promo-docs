Your roster is your agency's talent pool — a centralized directory of every brand ambassador you work with. There are several ways to add talent to your roster, from sharing an invite link to bulk-importing from a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

- An active agency account on Promo
- At least one published activation (for the invite link method)

## Navigate to your roster

Click **Roster** in the sidebar to open your talent directory. You'll see all your current brand ambassadors displayed as cards with their photos, names, and location.

</Frame>

Use the toolbar at the top to search by name, filter by starred status, or switch between card and list views.

## Open the Add Talent modal

Click the **Add Talent** button in the top-right corner. This opens a modal with four methods for adding ambassadors to your roster.

## Method 1: Share an invite link

The **Invite** tab is the simplest way to grow your roster. You get two options:

- **Share Link** — Copy your unique roster invite link and share it with ambassadors via text, social media, or any messaging platform. Anyone with this link can apply to join your roster.
- **Send via email** — Enter an email address and click **Send** to email the invite directly from Promo.

<Tip>
  The invite link is unique to your agency and stays active permanently. Bookmark it for quick sharing.
</Tip>

## Method 2: Add a single ambassador

Switch to the **Single** tab to manually add one person at a time. Fill in their basic details:

- **First Name** and **Last Name** (required)
- **Email** (required)

<Frame>

Click **Show additional fields** to add more details like phone number, gender, date of birth, address, internal notes, and up to 3 photos.

</Frame>

<Note>
  If the email matches an existing Promo account, the ambassador is automatically linked to your roster. Otherwise, they're added to your private roster as a pending entry.
</Note>

Before importing, you must accept the **consent statement** confirming you have permission to share the ambassador's personal data with Promo.

Check **Send invitation email** to automatically email the ambassador an invite to join Promo and connect with your agency.

## Method 3: Bulk CSV upload

Switch to the **Bulk** tab to import multiple ambassadors at once from a CSV file.

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the template">
    Click **Download Template** to get a CSV file with the correct column headers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in your data">
    Open the template and add your ambassador data. Required columns are `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`. Optional columns include `phone`, `gender`, `photo_1`, `photo_2`, and `photo_3`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload and review">
    Drag your CSV file into the upload area or click to browse. Promo will preview your data and flag any duplicates or errors before importing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept consent and import">
    Check the consent statement, then click **Import** to add all valid entries to your roster.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Photo columns accept URLs — if your ambassadors have headshots hosted online, include the direct image URLs in the `photo_1`, `photo_2`, and `photo_3` columns.
</Tip>

## Method 4: Import from another platform

Switch to the **Import** tab to migrate your roster from a staffing platform like PopBookings.

<Frame>
  ![Import tab showing PopBookings and StaffConnect options](/images/guides/adding-to-roster/step-6-import-tab.png)
</Frame>

Select **PopBookings** to upload a CSV export from PopBookings. Promo automatically maps PopBookings column names to the correct fields and downloads any linked photos.

<Note>
  StaffConnect import is coming soon. Contact support if you need to migrate from another platform not listed here.
</Note>

## View ambassador details

Click on any ambassador card to open the detail panel on the right side of the screen. This shows their full profile including:

- Media portfolio photos
- Work experience and education
- Skills and certifications
- Applications to your activations
- Reviews and ratings from your team

From the detail panel, you can:

- **Star** an ambassador to mark them as a favorite
- **Email** or **Phone** them directly
- Switch to the **Applications** tab to see their history with your agency
- Switch to the **Reviews** tab to add ratings and notes

## Tips

<Tip>
  Use the **Starred** toggle in the toolbar to quickly filter your roster down to your top talent.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Ambassadors who apply to your activations are automatically added to your roster — no manual import needed.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  When importing ambassadors, make sure you have their consent to share their personal data with Promo. This is required by the consent statement and helps protect everyone's privacy.
</Warning>
