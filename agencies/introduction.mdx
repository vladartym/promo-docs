- **Review applications** — Browse and manage incoming applications from brand ambassadors
- **Manage your roster** — Build a team of trusted ambassadors you can re-hire for future activations
- **Track check-ins** — Monitor ambassador attendance with GPS-verified check-ins
- **Communicate** — Message ambassadors directly through the platform
- **Customize forms** — Create custom application forms with additional screening questions

## Getting started

If you're new to Promo, start by creating your first activation to post a job opportunity and attract brand ambassadors.
