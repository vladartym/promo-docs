Messages lets you have conversations with brand ambassadors about your activations. You can reply to incoming questions, start new conversations with roster members, and view ambassador profiles — all from one place.

## Your inbox

Navigate to **Messages** in the sidebar to see all your conversations. Each conversation shows the ambassador's name, a preview of the last message, and the conversation status.

Unread conversations are highlighted with a dot next to the ambassador's name.

You can also use the search bar to find conversations by name, email, or message content.

## View an ambassador's profile

Click the ambassador's name in the conversation header to open their profile panel on the right. You can see their media portfolio, work experience, education, skills, and certifications without leaving the conversation.

From the profile panel you can also:
- **Email** or **Phone** the ambassador directly
- **Star** them for quick reference
- View their **Applications** and **Reviews** using the tabs

## Close and reopen conversations

Click the **Close** button in the conversation header to mark a conversation as resolved. Closed conversations move to the "Closed" filter view.

To reopen a closed conversation, select it and click **Reopen**. If an ambassador sends a new message to a closed conversation, it reopens automatically.

## Tips

<Tip>
  Use the resizable divider between the conversation list and detail panel to adjust the layout to your preference. Your panel size is saved automatically.

<Note>
  The unread count shown next to "Messages" in the sidebar updates in real time, so you always know when new messages arrive.
