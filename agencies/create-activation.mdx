Activations are job postings that brand ambassadors can apply to. This guide walks you through creating and publishing a new activation from your agency dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- An active agency account with access to the dashboard

## Creating your activation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Activations page">
    From your agency dashboard, click **Activations** in the sidebar. You'll see a list of all your current activations with their status (Draft, Published, Completed). Click the **New Activation** button in the top-right corner.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quick Create with AI (optional)">
    When the page loads, a **Quick Create with AI** dialog appears. You can paste activation details (like a job description from an email or document) and click **Auto-fill with AI** to automatically extract the title, description, and shift details.

    If you prefer to fill in the form manually, click **Skip**.

    <Tip>
      The Quick Create with AI feature works well when you have a job description from an email or document — just paste it in and let AI extract the details.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the activation details">
    Enter a **Title** for your activation and a detailed **Description**. The title is what brand ambassadors will see when browsing opportunities, so make it descriptive and location-specific.

    In the description, include what the role involves, any requirements, and what training will be provided.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your content">
    Fill in the title and a clear description of the opportunity. Be specific about what the role involves so applicants know what to expect.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the shift">
    Each activation needs at least one shift. Fill in the shift details:

    - **Role** — The job title for this shift (e.g., "Beauty Ambassador", "Sampling Specialist")
    - **Location** — Start typing an address and select from the suggestions. A map preview will confirm the location.
    - **Wage** — The pay amount for this shift
    - **Pay Rate** — Choose between Hourly, Daily, Flat, or Per Visit
    - **Date & Time** — Set the start and end date/time for the shift. Toggle **Ongoing** if there's no fixed end date.

    You can add more shifts by clicking **+ Add Shift** at the bottom of the section.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the application method">
    **Application Method** — Select how candidates apply:
    - **Promo (Easy Apply)** — Candidates apply directly through the platform. You can optionally attach a custom application form with additional questions.
    - **Email** — Candidates apply via email to an address you specify.
    - **Link** — Candidates are directed to an external application URL.

    **Boost Your Reach** — Toggle the **Email Blast** to notify the Promo network of 350,000+ brand ambassadors about your activation. Depending on your plan, this may be included for free.

    When you're ready, click **Publish Activation** to make it live, or **Save as Draft** to come back to it later.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Activation published">
    After publishing, you'll be redirected to the Activations list. Your new activation appears at the top with a **Published** badge. If you enabled the email blast, you'll also see a **Boosted** badge.

    Brand ambassadors can now find and apply to your activation.

## Tips

<Note>
  Use **Save as Draft** if you're not ready to publish yet. You can edit and publish drafts later from the activation detail page.
</Note>

<Tip>
  You can add multiple shifts to a single activation if the job spans different locations, dates, or roles.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Enabling the email blast significantly increases visibility, especially for time-sensitive activations.
